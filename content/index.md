# Research

My research sets out to make fast hardware easy to use.
We design compilers, software engineering tools and
hardware design tools to make this easier.

The key questions I set out to answer are:

- How do we make hardware accelerators easy to use?
- How can we improve existing programming models (in particular, APIs and DSLs)?
- How do we make it easier to build compilers for hardware accelerators?
- What tools do programmers need to use hardware accelerators?
- How can we use compilers to co-design hardware?
- Can we leverage hardware accelerators to reduce carbon emissions?
